This is an unfinished work. 
Its purpose was to implement an emulator for a DECSYSTEM-20 using a PDP-10 KL processor with extended memory.
The project came to an abrubpt end when the Alpha Processor ironically suffered a similar fate as the PDP-10.

Whats mostly done is a framework implementing the Virtual Memory and instruction fetch of the machine.

The Project was assembled with a slighly modified version of gas (GNU asembler) on a native alpha ev4.
