This is an unfinished work. 
Its purpose was to implement an emulator for a DECSYSTEM-20 using a PDP-10 KL processor with extended memory.
The project came to an abrupt end when the Alpha Processor ironically suffered a similar fate as the PDP-10.

Whats mostly done is a framework implementing the Virtual Memory and instruction fetch of the machine.

The Project was assembled with a slighly modified version of gas (GNU asembler) on a native alpha ev4.

The intention here was to find a project to develop to learn Alpha assembler and write a book. This of course died with the announcement killing the Alpha processor and Tru64 UNIX. Almost an ironic mirror of the death of Jupiter and the whole PDP-10 line :(
